    to be evil as they prey on human beings to drain them of their life force. The gameplay of
    playing a Fryhtan Kwyzan is significantly different than that of playing a Human Kingdom,
    in that the Fryhtans do not have a reputation and actually get rewarded for performing
    atrocities and heinous acts of violence. </font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The All High is the main leader, similar in respects to a Human
    King. There can only be one All High at any one time, and while the Fryhtans do not have
    reputations, they do have loyalty, so losing an All High can send their loyalties
    plummeting. (Warning: If any Fryhtan is outside and their loyalty reaches zero, they will
    simply disappear.) The All High is best kept at the main lair to train others.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Ordos are leaders directly under the reign of the All High
    and they mainly lead and train squads of Crouls or Animals to boost their combat
    effectiveness. If the All High ever dies, one of the Ordos would be the best choice to
    take the All High ruler position, though any Fryhtan Unit can be an All High or an Ordo.
    Their leadership skill will increase and further develop if they are training others or
    taking command of a squad in battle.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Crouls are any and all other Fryhtans that are not Ordos or
    the All High and make up the bulk of the Fryhtan Kwyzan. They usually have low leaderships
    that do not tend to develop further unless they are put in command as an Ordo.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Animals are unintelligent beasts of burden that the Fryhtans
    control, to help bolster their own fighting force. They have no morale or leadership and
    can never be but in command positions..</font></p>

    <p><font color="#8080FF">The Fryhtan Rush</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Some of the stronger and more durable of Fryhtans are capable of
    a tactic which we like to call the &quot;Fryhtan Rush&quot;, whereby the starting Fryhtans
    attempt to crush an enemy kingdom early on in the game, usually most effective on a human
    kingdom. The Fryhtan Rush is highly dependent on the starting location of each player and
    how close they are to each other. If a Fryhtan Rush opportunity presents itself against a
    human opponent, start by having your Fryhtans attacking the population as far from their
    fort as possible and try to draw civilians and soldiers out away from their forts and
    villages. If it turns out that you cannot utterly destroy the kingdom, do as much damage
    as possible to the population to cripple them, and retreat back to the safety of your
    lair. This tactic is advantageous in that you are attacking them before they can establish
    any sort of viable defense but also very risky in that if you are unsuccessful, you might
    lose the entire game, with not enough forces, money or Life Points to continue. Another
    advantage in attacking a human player kingdom is that their civilians will always be
    minimum in hit points (20 HP) while other independent villages may be considerably higher
    (20-200 HP) depending on what option the game's resistance is set to.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Using and Abusing Humans</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">While the humans think the Fryhtans are little more than animals,
    the Fryhtan's outlook on humans are that they are little more than livestock. Humans
    provide Fryhtans with their primary source of life points and cash flow which is necessary
    for the Fryhtans to continue expansion and further development of their Kwyzan. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Fryhtans can enslave humans by attacking independent villages,
    until their resistance reaches zero, at which point the Fryhtans will automatically stop
    attacking. The enslaved village will then offer a tribute year round while there is an
    Ordo or All High in a Lair connected to the village. The amount of tribute can be checked
    by clicking on the enslaved village and is dependent on the leadership of the Ordo or All
    High and how many people are actually still alive from that particular village.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">If for some reason, the independent village is not desirable for
    enslavement, attack the zero resistance village until it is destroyed. Civilians may
    actually join the Fryhtans, rather than face ultimate destruction. The humans can then be
    used to build structures available to their nationality, but be warned that they may
    betray you at any moment due to their low loyalties. Use them while you can or pay them
    tribute to keep their loyalties high. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Human buildings can be attached to and operated by enslaved
    villages, such as Towers of Science, War Factories, Mines and Factories (only if fortunate
    enough to have a mineral resource nearby), and even Seats of Power (if you are lucky
    enough to find the proper Scroll of Power).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Enslaved villages will grow very slowly if at all, but if ever
    your Fryhtans need a small dose of Life Points instead of money, feel free to feed on your
    livestock. They will not fight back. It is not necessary to utterly destroy them, but take
    only what you need.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Fryhtans Are NOT Expendable</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">No Fryhtan should ever be considered expendable and critically
    damaged units should be retreated back to safety if at all possible as they are extremely
    costly in both money and Life Points. Most Fryhtans are easily capable of retreating when
    fighting humans as Fryhtans are usually so much faster than their initial infantrymen. The
    experience they have gained can only be beneficial and even a Fryhtan near death can train
    other units back at the lair, or be trained further themselves.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Purchasing the Loyalties of an Independent Lair</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">More than likely, there are going to be several types of
    independent Frythan lairs available throughout the game. To purchase the loyalties of a
    particular lair, first build a lair connecting it to the one in question. Then place an
    Ordo or All High inside your connected lair and select the independent lair. Press the
    icon to pay tribute and the cost of their loyalties will be shown in gold. (Note: You can
    get an independent lair cheaply at this point by attacking the lair. When they all come
    out to do battle, you can then pay a cheap $2000 to take their lair and the remaining
    independent Fryhtans will then disappear.)</font></p>

    href="#An Introduction to Fryhtan Gameplay">Back</a></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Bregma Fryhtans are a monstrous form of insectoid life and
    they often use other forms of mutated giant insects, called the Bheema and the Tarmes, to
    bolster their own armies. They are quick in movement, attacking, and in using their
    special &quot;Spiny Butterfly&quot; melee attack. Their training costs are the least
    expensive of all Fryhtans but they are also the weakest of the Fryhtans, both offensively
    and defensively, plus they do not have any ranged attack capabilities (unless you count
    the Bheemas). </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The best tactics for the Bregma is to swarm its
    opposition with overwhelming numbers of cheap troops. Unfortunately, since these Fryhtans
    are so weak, it is usually not possible to do so early in the game, making the
    &quot;Fryhtan Rush&quot; suicidal. The Bregma Crouls are their main melee force and need
    to bolster their meager hit points either by training in a lair or by actual combat. They
    gain their special melee attack which I call &quot;Spiny Butterfly&quot; when they achieve
    a Combat Skill of at least 40 points. When clearly outmatched in battle, the best tactic
    is to flee and regroup as they are nearly capable of outrunning Human Cavalry and can
    clearly outdistance any Human Infantry. Consider the animal units, Bheema and Tarmes, to
    be support units only, as they are best used tactically in certain situations as described
    in further detail below. Enslave villages for money instead of destroying them for Life
    Points as the Bregma need large amounts of money throughout the game to support their vast
    numbers and they require very few life points respectively with the exception of the
    initial research.)</font></p>

    Life Points in 20 days.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#8080FF">Bheema</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Bheema are giant killer bees which die upon stinging their
    victims, but deal a massive amount of damage in the process. They are the quickest of all
    creatures and the only creatures in the game that have the capability of flight, which
    allow them to ignore the effects of any terrain features. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Bheema can also attack buildings, as well as
    villages, but with slightly less effectiveness. Best used in swarms to take out leaders of
    formations. Be sure to right-double-click to force the attack on your target so they do
    not get distracted by other attackers or use the Stand Your Ground Mode. They are quick
    and sturdy enough that even a ranged defense against their attack is near impossible. They
    are also quite capable in assisting others in the destruction of those pesky armed human
    fortifications.)</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Note: Each level of research increases the minimum amount of
    Bheema damage by 15 HP.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Bheemas can be trained in Bheema Hyfes for $70 plus 10 Life
    Points in 20 days.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Tarmes</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Tarmes is a giant termite which has an appetite for wood and
    deals considerable damage to wooden constructs, especially buildings, walls and war
    machines. They are nearly the slowest creatures in the game, both in movement and in
    attacks. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Tarmes are ineffective against any
    non-wooden units in the game, doing minimal damage if any at all. Best used in swarms to
    take down the walls of independent or enemy villages, with a followup support force of
    Bregma to engage the civilians or warriors. The Tarmes can then focus on a nearby building
    or village wall, rather than slowly retreating to the nearest lair. They are the least
    expensive animals in the game and therefore expendable. Use them immediately as further
    training of them has little effectiveness other than the slight gaining of hit points.)</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Exovum Fryhtans are monstrous bipedal lizards with magical
    tendencies. They are capable of channeling a wide variety of powerful spell abilities
    through structures called Mage Tors. Not only are they gifted in the magical arts, but
    they are gifted defensively with high Hit Points, as well as offensively, as they possess
    the quickest melee and ranged attack. They can also breathe fire and their ranged attacks
    can freeze their opponents for a short period of time. Their weaknesses are slight, with a
    training cost above average and a slower than average movement rate.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: There are many different tactics available to
    Exovum Fryhtans, as they are the most balanced and flexible of the Fryhtans with regards
    to strength, defense, speed and raw power. They are strong enough to engage in a
    &quot;Fryhtan Rush&quot; early in the game to take out an enemy player kingdom, though it
    is recommended to have at least one Mage Tor fully charged before doing so, to supplement
    their assault. They gain the use of their special melee &quot;Firebreath&quot; attack when
    they achieve a Combat Skill of at least 40 points and a powerful &quot;Freezing&quot;
    ranged attack at a Combat Skill of at least 70 points. The Exovum Fryhtans require vast
    amounts of Life Points throughout the game, especially if the Mage Tors spells are used to
    their fullest capabilities. The best way to accumulate Life Points for them is by
    destroying most independent villages rather than enslaving them, while keeping a few
    easily defended villages enslaved for additional funds.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Exovum Fryhtans can be trained in Exovum Lairs for $220 plus 110
    Life Points in 35 days.</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Mage Tor</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Mage Tor is a structure that automatically renews magical
    energy slowly over time. When a Mage Tor is fully charged it is capable of channeling any
    spell researched, anywhere on the map, for a cost of Life Points. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Life Point Cost depends on the distance from
    the selected Mage Tor to the Target for each spell. The further the distance, the higher
    the cost. When a spell is selected, place the cursor over the target area and note the
    cost in life points in the right hand side of the screen. To lower the costs of each
    spell, simply build your Mage Tors closer to the enemy. Ideal positions for Mage Tors are
    near the center of the map, as this automatically cuts the distance of the entire map in
    half, allowing flexibility in dealing with multiple enemies from different directions.
    Build multiple Mage Tors if possible so that one is always fully charged and ready for
    use. To find your Mage Tors quickly hit the &quot;F&quot; hotkey and to move quickly
    between several available Mage Tors, press the &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;End&quot;
    hotkeys.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Mage Tors can be built anywhere by the Exovum Fryhtans at a cost
    of $500 plus 100 Life Points.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Note: Mage Tors cannot be built until at least one Magic Spell
    has been researched.)</font></p>
    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Mage Tor's Magic Spells</font></p>
    </b><p><font color="#FDF0FF"><b>Damage Building</b>: Destroys half of the maximum number
    of Hit Points of targetted building. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: Casting this magic twice can potentially destroy
    any type of building, if they do not repair. Best when used to take out those pesky armed
    Forts before attacking or other buildings of significance, such as powerful MegaStructures
    and expensive Seats of Power. Be prudent in the use of the Damage Building spell, as it
    tends to use a significant amount of the Mage Tor charge, and the recharge rate is rather
    slow.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Damage Buildings research cost is 1800 Life Points.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF"><b>Freeze Units</b>: Freezes all attackable units within a 9x9
    square area for 15 days.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Note: The Freeze Units spell uses very little of the
    Mage Tor energy and can keep enemy units frozen almost indefinitely as the Mage Tor will
    recharge back to maximum before they are unfrozen.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Freeze Units research cost is 800 Life Points.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF"><b>Damage Units</b>: Damages all attackable units within a 9x9
    square area for 100 HP Total, evenly distributed.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: Best used to soften large groups of opposition
    before or even during battle. The Damage Units spell can be quite high depending on the
    distance, so be sure to watch the life costs indicator. This spell can be used quickly and
    often as it drains very little energy from the Mage Tor.)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">Wound Units research cost is 1200 Life Points.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF"><b>Teleport Unit</b>: Teleports a single selected unit to any map
    area selected.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Note: The Teleport Unit spell is extremely useful in
    pulling out endangered or surrounded units back to an area of safety where they can heal
    in a lair. This spell ability can also be used to quickly explore the map when necessary.
    This spell drains a significant amount of energy from the Mage Tor so it may take time to
    fully recharge.)</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Ezpinez Fryhtans can do a decent amount of
    damage with their melee attack, but their attacks are very slow making them seem
    ineffective in battle. They do gain a special &quot;FireSword&quot; melee attack at Combat
    Skill Level 50, but are mostly reliant on the powerful ranged attacks of their War
    Machines, which are cheap and deadly even at the initial levels of development.
    Furthermore, each additional level of development signficantly enhances their damage
    dealing capabilities and their construction requires no life points, only money. The best
    tactic for the Ezpinez is to research any War Machine, build a Vapngart and start cranking
    the War Machines out. Since the main fighting force requires no life points, except for
    further research and development, money should be the main concern, so enslaved all
    independent villages as soon as possible. Since the war machines are extremely slow and
    inexpensive and are obsolete once new technology breakthroughs have been made, they should
    be considered highly expendable. It is not even necessary to sortie them out as a squad
    with an Ordo as they do not actually possess a Combat Skill and therefore will be
    uneffected by their leadership.)</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Grokken Fryhtans are massive humanoid mountains composed of
    living stone and minerals which are actually capable of melding with each other to create
    mountain fortresses that are indistinguishable from any normal mountain. They have the
    most powerful of the melee and ranged attacks plus the highest defensive capabilities of
    all Fryhtans, but are also one of the slowest and least maneuverable of any unit due to
    their massive bulk. They are the most expensive units available in the game and the
    slowest to train, thus making their numbers few.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Grokken Fryhtans are at the greatest
    disadvantage early on in the game, due to their high costs in money and Life Points and it
    will only be possible to train a few new Crouls, taking 2 months each. There are only a
    few viable tactics available, depending on your situation. The first option is to find a
    highly defensible location away from enemy players, preferably near a mountain range, then
    to either train in seclusion or to enslave nearby independent villages to bolster your
    money and Life Points. The second option is to train units immediately, while your initial
    force is enslaving nearby independent villages, especially if the starting location is
    already decently defendable. The third option is to keep all Grokken Fryhtans inside their
    lair, training until they achieve a Combat Skill of at least 35 points which is when they
    acquire their ranged attack. (Note: They also get a powerful &quot;Energy Boulder&quot;
    special ranged attack at a 50 Combat Skill.) Without the ranged attacks, the Grokken
    Fryhtans are at a distinct disadvantage due to their low manueverability and slow speed.
    Do not let your Grokkens get surrounded, as they are so much larger, they can be attacked
    by more enemies in melee combat and are less likely to escape. Critically damaged units
    should retreat if possible back to a lair or to a group of undamaged Grokken Fryhtans
    where they can meld together into a Mountain Fortress and share their health (discussed in
    greater detail later). Each Grokken Fryhtan is so expensive that none of them should be
    considered expendable. Research is expensive too, but Fortress Level I is well worth the
    cost, if you have an excess of Life Points, if only to get the lifesharing capabilities,
    but leave the rest of the research alone until later in the game. Both money and Life
    Points are an excessive necessity for the Grokken Fryhtans, with money taking slightly
    higher priority, so enslave all independent villages possible.)</font></p>

    <b><p><font color="#8080FF">Fortress</b> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Fortress is created when any four Grokken Fryhtans meld
    together and by doing so, quickly build a mountainous structure with Hit Points comprised
    of their total combined health. This structure can hold up to four other non-human units,
    and those inside that are capable of firing ranged attacks, can do so from within, without
    danger of being attacked themselves. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: If any of the Grokken Fryhtans happened to be
    damaged at the time of Fortress creation, it is possible to repair the Fortress like any
    other building, thus healing the Fryhtans inside as well. If the Fortress is sold or the
    Grokken Fryhtans that created the Fortress withdraw from the meld, each Grokken Fryhtan
    will be of equivalent proportional health. Especially useful in getting critically damaged
    but highly skilled Grokken Fryhtans stabilized and back into the fight after melding.)</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">The Kerassos Fryhtans are demonic in nature with an affinity for
    animal life forms, namely the Jaguara, the Goril, and the Rhinokeros, and are capable of
    quickly luring them to their Keraal Structure where they can bind them to their will, thus
    bolstering their own ranks with inexpensive animal units. The Kerassos Fryhtans are fairly
    balanced in costs with regards to their offense and defense, possessing decently
    strengthed but rather slow melee and ranged attacks, though they are the fastest moving of
    all the Fryhtans. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: Even though the Kerassos Fryhtans are decent in
    combat and excellent scouts, they seem to be little more than support units for the
    animals which they control, supplementing the strengths of the animals in battle, with
    their leadership and ranged support. Basically, the Kerassos are the brains, while the
    animals are the bodies. There are many different tactics available to the Kerassos, the
    best of which is to research Rhinokeros as soon as possible, build a Keraal, possess the
    Rhinokeros animals when available and send them to the All High for training to bolster
    their Hit Points. Promote a Croul to an Ordo and sortie with a full squad of Rhinokeros,
    putting them in a protective square or circle formation, and start taking out independent
    villages or even enemy villages if possible. The Ordo will gain leadership extremely quick
    this way making the Rhinokeros even more effective. Keep expanding as quick as possible,
    building more Keraals enslaving villages. Do not worry too much about losing animals as
    they are inexpensive and easily replaceable, however a well trained Ordo is not expendable
    and should be returned to a lair to sortie with a new squad of animals. The Kerassos
    Fryhtans also acquire a powerful &quot;DemonFire&quot; melee attack at Combat Skill Level
    60, but is rather difficult to use as they tend to resort to ranged attacks. The Kerassos
    Fryhtans require a balance of money for animals and Life Points for research, so it is
    best to enslave as many villages as possible, destroying a few that are not strategically
    located and focus on the enemy for your other needs through combat.)</font></p>

    until needed, and ultimately their wills to be bound under the Kerassos Fryhtans' control.
    The Keraal fills up with animals at random depending on the type of lures researched and
    can be dominated immediately for a small cost of money and Life Points, corresponding to
    their Combat Skill Level and type of animal.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: It is best to take the animals as quickly as
    they arrive, as their Combat Skills will continue to increase while in the Keraal, thus
    adding to their monetary costs. Keep the Keraal empty if possible or at least try to keep
    the Keraal from getting full (maximum capacity of five animals) to keep a constant stream
    of animals coming in quickly.)</font></p>

    the most stolid of warhorses when they are hunting, but with tendencies of leaving huge
    gaps in their defense during their blood lust.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Jaguara makes an excellent inexpensive scout
    and decent combatants in large numbers, with the right leadership. Jaguara Level II are
    even faster, stronger, and more durable and can acquire a special ability &quot;Roar&quot;

    particularly nasty temper. When so enraged, they have been known to stampede even
    elephants, not to mention other wildlife in the nearby vicinity. Their bulky frame makes
    them slow in moving about on land, but they are quick to react to any nearby threat,
    pounding and swiping with their heavily muscled longreaching arms with deadly intent.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Goril are excellent warriors striking hard
    and fast, but are amongst the slowest of creatures. Best used to take out nearby targets
    or as a defensive garrison. Goril Level II are slightly faster, stronger, more durable,
    and can also acquire a special &quot;Outrage&quot; attack at Combat Skill Level 50 that is
    capable of causing ALL types of Human Cavalry to lose their morale, thus losing control of

    their horn at uncharacteristicly high speeds for a creature of this size.</font></p>

    capable of competing with other Fryhtan units on the same Combat Skill Level for a mere

    selfpropogating man-eating acid-spitting plants, called Lishorr. The Kharshuf Fryhtans are
    dangerous as the spiny cacti, strong and sturdy as the mighty oaks, but with tendencies to
    only creep vinelike along the earth. Some of the older Kharshuf Fryhtans have even been
    known to discharge a green electical shock, caused by the high acid content in their juice
    fluids combined with the huge amounts of minerals absorbed from the earth. Each Kharshuf
    Fryhtan costs a significant amount of green.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Kharshuf Fryhtans are well balanced with a
    strong offense and defense, but are slow moving and high costing. They have one of the
    strongest melee attacks early on and gain a special &quot;Sylvan Juice Shock&quot; melee
    attack at a Combat Skill Level of 40 points but have no ranged attacks, relying on the
    Lishorr to provide short range attack support. It is best to research Lishorr I, Wilde
    Lishorr, and Camoflage as soon as possible and use them appropriately throughout, while
    continuing to build up a force of Kharshuf Fryhtans. They are strong enough early in the
    game to instigate a &quot;Fryhtan Rush&quot; assault upon an enemy player's kingdom if
    they are nearby when starting out. Best tactic is to stay put and expand outwards,
    enslaving villages, building forests of Lishorr and infiltrating enemy lands with Wilde
    Lishorr. Due to their slow speed, be warned that retreating may not be possible and that
    travelling any distance will take a significant amount of time, though All Kharshuf

    forms and buildings except for the Kharshuf Fryhtans.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Wilde Lishorr should be planted near enemy
    territory as they are hostile to all non-Kharshuf Fryhtan lifeforms and will spread across
    the land automatically over time. If the Wilde Lishorr have the Camoflage ability, this
    incursion into enemy territory will be unnoticed until the enemy gets close enough to
    attack. For this reason, it is best to plant far enough away from the enemy that they will
    not be discovered too soon and be able to grow into a powerful forest. Plant Wilde Lishorr
    in tight groups of about 3-4 if possible and they will take over as much space available
    when they next grow and spread, filling every nook and cranny across the land. Be careful

    be reckoned with. Another useful tactic is to plant a camoflaged forest of Wilde Lishorr

    attacks, but rather weak in bodily defense.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FDF0FF">(Tactical Notes: The Minotauros Fryhtans are quick and powerful
    melee attackers, fast movers, but low in actual Hit Points, with a moderate cost per unit,
    making them fairly well balanced. They even get a quick and powerful special
    &quot;Vorpal&quot; melee attack at Combat Skill Level 50, but their main strengths lies in
    the use of their Alchemist Tors. This automatic process of gaining and managing money and
    Life Points, is the one most unique and valuable of all Fryhtan abilities. The gaining of
    Life Points passively, rather than only by combat, is valuable early on in the game, while
    the ability to convert those Life Points to a much needed money source later in the game,
    gives the Minotauros Fryhtans flexibility that other Fryhtans lack. Therefore, the
    Minotauros Fryhtans are highly sought out by other Fryhtan species if only for their Mage
    Tor capabilities. The best tactic for Minotauros depends on the starting location as it
    would be better to be near mineral resources and away from any enemy players, then
    research the conversion process 'Minerals to Gold' if planning to build more Fryhtans and
    Tors or 'Minerals to Life Points' if planning to focus on research. If there are no
    mineral resources available for the taking, research the conversion process 'Life Points
    to Gold' as soon as possible, while enslaving independent villages as normal and culling
    them for lifepoints. Eventually, all research will be beneficial, but since each
    conversion process is so expensive to research, be selective depending on the situation.
    The &quot;Fryhtan Rush&quot; is not really possible due to their weak defense, but hit and
    run tactics work well for the Minotauros Fryhtans, as they can do alot of damage quickly
    during a short period of time and then run away with only the quickest of Human Cavalry
    units and some Fryhtans capable of keeping up. While the Minotauros are not all that
    expensive and money and Life Points are easy to come by throughout the game, they should
    still not be considered expendable. Experienced units should be salvaged at every
    opportunity.)</font></p>
